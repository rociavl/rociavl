# Hi, I'm Rocío Ávalos 👋

I'm a Biomedical Engineering student passionate about applying **Artificial Intelligence** to solve problems in **biomedicine** and **neuroscience**.  
Currently working on projects involving brain imaging, medical AI, and bioinformatics.

- 🔭 I’m working on automatic segmentation of SEEG electrodes and brain masks using deep learning.  
- 🌱 Learning advanced bioinformatics, biostatistics, and generative models for synthetic patient data.  
- 💬 Ask me about machine learning in medical imaging, Python, or biomedical data analysis.  
- 📫 How to reach me: [rocio.avalos029@gmail.com](mailto:rociavl@gmail.com)  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love combining AI with neuroscience to push boundaries in healthcare!
